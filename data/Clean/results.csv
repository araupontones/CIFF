scenario and a “conservative” scenario. The
accelerated scenario assumes the current policy
momentum for EVs, renewables, and other end-use
applications. This will trigger the market and lead
to high penetration of these technologies. In the
accelerated scenario, battery demand rises in line
with expected success of India’s ambitions and
incentives around vehicle electrification and grid
decarbonization. The conservative scenario assumes
battery demand rises in line with the most
conservative expert forecasts.

The revised freight forwarder scheme (FFS) aims to promote expansion of the commodity basket of railways, through aggregation of goods at private freight terminals and goods sheds, but has design flaws that make it unattractive to customers. Further, major operational and logistical issues like terminal congestion, inadequate access roads to stations, poor warehousing infrastructure, high handling charges and first/last mile costs, high transit time have driven freight customers to more expensive but convenient, reliable road transport services.
Solutions recommended are a separate unit in the Railways to manage small traffic - freight forwarders, domestic containers, and parcels traffic and flexible policy framework."
