developing detailed action plans for each. Campaigns are expected to go live by mid-July in the two states,consisting of:
- Human Stories that celebrate unique stories of people using buses through print, electronic,
digital, and social media (blogs, videos)
- Living Lab experiments that assess the impact of quick-to-implement interventions in
collaboration with city agencies. The solutions/designs shall be developed in collaboration with local academic institutions and experts
- A Ride to Remember that will get influential citizens—including decision makers, corporates, celebrities, and social media influencers—to experience city buses and become their champions. The goal is to also get corporates and local businesses to encourage bus use through special programmes/offers to their staff as well as citizens.

ICCT,ZEV,Output,Completed,2021-First Half,Communication pieces developed ,Improve awareness and adoption of EV,"The objective of the vehicle fuel efficiency work is to get India to adopt 2025-2030 standards on par 
with the EU standards. ICCT have had to expend some energy in preventing the 
backsliding of existing FY2022-23 standards by writing a blog on 'Inertia of outdated regulation: How manufacturers can take advantage of India's fuel economy test procedure'. ICCT believes that preventing such backsliding is essential if future standards are to be stringent in order to accelerate 
vehicle electrification. ICCT's work is going to not only demonstrate that the existing standards are 
easy to achieve, but also that standards could/should be tightened based on the available cost-effective technology pathway. Blog published on January 13, 2021"
