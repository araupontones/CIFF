ICCT,ZEV,Output,blog on 'Inertia of outdated regulation',Completed,2021-First Half,Communication pieces developed ,Improve awareness and adoption of EV,"The objective of the vehicle fuel efficiency work is to get India to adopt 2025-2030 standards on par 
with the EU standards. ICCT have had to expend some energy in preventing the 
backsliding of existing FY2022-23 standards by writing a blog on 'Inertia of outdated regulation: How manufacturers can take advantage of India's fuel economy test procedure'. ICCT believes that preventing such backsliding is essential if future standards are to be stringent in order to accelerate

During these discussions, everyone agreed that there is little clarity on the legal basis for implementing LEZs in India, without which adoption and enforcement will be difficult. Due to the relevance and importance of this subject, we started studying the legal framework to support clean air initiatives in India and the legal framework for LEZs around the world. We have completed the first draft of the paper and it will soon be sent for the first internal review."
